Expense Reporting Application

This app allows a user to login or create a new account for logging into the expense reporting system. Once logged in if user is not an approver, the user selects a date and enters or clicks on other expense choices shown. If user missed selecting or entering data in required fields, a warning message appears informing user the highlighted fields were missed.  When expense is saved with no errors, it shows up in expense list in bottom half of page in pending status.  The user can then click on any previously saved expense shown in the list and submit it for approval, delete it, or edit it again. 

If user is an approver, upon logging in, there is a left side nav section that shows buttons that will show (1) the expense creation page along with his/her expenses listed in bottom half of screen, and (2) the list of users whose expenses he/she needs to approve.  When a user is clicked, their expenses show up in the expense view along with buttons approve or reject.
